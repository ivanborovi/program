here i have project in visual studio net 9.0 . its in c#. Libraries DocX and Fonet.Core. Write all the code yourself so it works and i can copy paste entire file in. there is a project template, all you need to do is fill the code how TODO and commented  instructions are telling you to and not change preset code. where you can write stuff in code or however you need to acording to the  TODO instructions and preset.
i attached files from the project that need to be filled to work, if you think you need any other files for extra context say so. There is also attached picture of some extra instructions .
